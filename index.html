    <p class="headline">The Habit of Creative Cooperation</p>
    <div class="text1">
      <p>
        To put it simply, synergy means “two heads are better than one.”
        Synergize is the habit of creative cooperation. It is teamwork,
        open-mindedness, and the adventure of finding new solutions to old
        problems. But it doesn’t happen on its own. It’s a process, and through
        that process, people bring all their personal experience and expertise
        to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, they can produce far better results than they could
        individually. Synergy lets us discover jointly things we are much less
        likely to discover by ourselves. It is the idea that the whole is
        greater than the sum of the parts. One plus one equals three, or six, or
        sixty—you name it.
      </p>

      <p>
        When people begin to interact together genuinely, and they’re open to
        each other’s influence, they begin to gain new insight. The capability
        of inventing new approaches is increased exponentially because of
        differences.
      </p>

      <p>
        Valuing differences is what really drives synergy. Do you truly value
        the mental, emotional, and psychological differences among people? Or do
        you wish everyone would just agree with you so you could all get along?
        Many people mistake uniformity for unity and sameness for oneness. One
        word—boring! Differences should be seen as strengths, not weaknesses.
        They add zest to life.

        Many people think in terms of either/or: either you’re nice or you’re
        tough. Win-win requires that you be both. It is a balancing act between
        courage and consideration.

        There are three vital character traits that are essential to this
        paradigm:

      <ul>
        <li>Have a change of heart.</li>
        <li>Feel new energy and excitement.</li>
        <li>See things in a new way.</li>
        <li>Feel that the relationship has transformed.</li>
        <li>
          End up with an idea or a result that is better than what either of you
          started with (3rd Alternative).

        “Synergy is not the same as compromise. In a compromise, one plus one
        equals one and a half at best.”
